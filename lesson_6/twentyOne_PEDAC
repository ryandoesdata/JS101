Deal cards to player and dealer

/*

Input: The deck variable.
Output: four properties and a mutated deck

Rules: 

Examples and Validation: 

52 properties in deck

cards are dealt

player has 2 properties, dealer has 2 properties, deck has 4 less properties.

Data Structure:

Player and dealer should be variables with one empty array each. Random dealt cards (key/values)
will be pushed from the deck into the player and dealer's arrays.

Algorithm:

let player = []
let dealer = []

Push four random, spliced elements from the deck into each player's hand. This removes those
element from the deck and puts it in their hand.

Use a loop to push two cards into each hand. Or just copy paste the code so it does it twice?

Code:

let player = [];

player.push(deck.splice(Math.floor(Math.random() * deck.length), 1));

player = player.flat();

console.log(deck);

console.log(player);

*/

Player turn: hit or stay

/*

Input: Player input, pushing another card into the player's hand.
Output: A mutated deck with one less card, and another element in player's hand.
        The new card is added onto the value of player's hand.

Rules for hit:

New card adds onto the total value of player's hand.

If the new total is over 21, player busts.

If total is under 21, ask hit or stay again.

If the next card is an ace AND the value of the player's hand is greater than 11, ace will equal 1

If the player's hand is greater than 11, all aces become equal to 1.



Examples and Validation: 

Prompt player hit or stay.

Player hits

Player has a 4 and a 6 in their hand. Hand equals 10.
Player decides to hit. 
Player is dealt a 7.
Player's hand now equals 17.

Deck has one less card.

Repeat

Player has a 4 and a 6 and a 7 in their hand. Hand equals 17.
Player decides to stay.

Break

Different Scenerio:

Player has 4 and 7. Hand = 11.
Player gets ace.
Player's hand equals 21.



Data Structure:

Variable for points in hand.

while loop

Prompt user "You have x points. Enter hit or stay."
valid input?

if hit:

Player's hand equals hand plus new card

if stay:

break



Algorithm:

let playerPoints = sum of both elements in playerHand

while (true) {
  while (true) {
    Prompt user "You have x points. Enter hit or stay."
    valid input? No
    "That is not valid input"
    valid input? Yes
    break;
  }

if answer = hit:

Player's hand equals hand plus new card

if hand is greater than 21

break

if stay:

break

Code:

let player = [];

player.push(deck.splice(Math.floor(Math.random() * deck.length), 1));

player = player.flat();

console.log(deck);

console.log(player);

Toggle Aces

/*

Input: A number
Output: A number

Rules: 

Examples and Validation: 

if total is greater than 20, A = 1

Data Structure:

conditional statement

Algorithm:

Take the array of player's and dealer's full object literals. Player and Dealer variables

Use a conditional statement: when the total > 20, the 11s become 1s (values).

Or the aces (keys) become 1s (values).



Push four random, spliced elements from the deck into each player's hand. This removes those
element from the deck and puts it in their hand.

Use a loop to push two cards into each hand. Or just copy paste the code so it does it twice?

Code:

let player = [];

player.push(deck.splice(Math.floor(Math.random() * deck.length), 1));
