Input: A string
Output: A number

Rules: 

The input must be one of three options: Player, Computer, or Tie (else)

The output must be 1, added onto the existing number for Player or Computer,
or, in the event of a tie, a 0 (repeat without changes).

The match will repeat until someone wins 5 games, at which point the score
returns to 0.

Hint: Use a global constant to represent the number of games needed to win the match.

Data Structure:

A function that takes in the winner of the game.
Two variables, one for the Player's score, one for the Computer's.

An if statement:
  if the Player wins, which adds one to their score.
  if the Computer wins, which adds one to their score.
  Else, where nothing changes.

Another if statement:
  if player's score equals 5, log the player wins.
  Same for computer.

Input:                        Output:

keepScore(Player)             'Player: 1 Computer: 0'
keepScore(Player) (times 5)   'Player wins the match!'
keepScore(tie)                'Player: 0 Computer: 0'

Algorithm

keepScore(winner) {

let playerScore = 0
let computerScore = 0

if (winner = 'Player') {
  playerScore += 1
} else if (winner = 'Computer') {
  computerScore += 1
}

if (playerScore = 5) {
  console.log('Player wins the match!)
} else if (computerScore = 5) {
  console.log('Computer wins the match!')
}
}
