Input: Nothing? A function?
Output: A string

Rules: 

String must contain only letters a - f, lowercase, and numbers 0-9.
String must include dashes after the 8th, 13th, 18th, and 23rd character.
String must contain groups of 8 - 4 - 4 - 4 - and 12 characters. Dashes not included.

Data Structure:

Input: 

A function with no arguments.

Output:

A UUID string.

Examples and Test Cases:

Input: 

let function UUID => {
  code
}

Output:

'12345678-abcd-ef12-3456-7890abcdef01'

Algorithm:

Declare an empty array to push the characters into.

Declare a function with no arguments.

Inside the function use Math.floor, and Math.random (times 16) to obtain the random numbers and letters. 0 through 9 are '0' - '9' and 10 - 15 are 'a' - 'f'.

Reapeat 32 times, pushing the characters into the array.

Create variables for the groups. firstGroup, secondGroup, thirdGroup, fourthGroup, and fifthGroup.

Join the characters so each group is one string.

Interpolate the variables together with dashes in between.
