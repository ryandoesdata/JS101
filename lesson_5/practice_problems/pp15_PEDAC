Input: An array of object literals
Output: An array of object literals

Rules: 

New array must contain only the objects where all the numbers are even.

Data Structure:

Input: 

An array with three elements. Each element is an object literal.

The first element has one object, the second has three, and the third has two.

The objects' keys are all letters.

The objects' values are arrays of integers.

Output:

The same structure as the input, but only the objects whose values contain only even numbers.

Examples and Test Cases:

Input: 

let arr = [
  { a: [1, 2, 3] },
  { b: [2, 4, 6], c: [3, 6], d: [4] },
  { e: [8], f: [6, 10] },
];

Output:
[  
  { b: [2, 4, 6], d: [4], e: [8], f: [6, 10] }
];

Question: is a key value pair an object? I don't think so...That's a property of an object. Yes, the object literal, or object, is contained within one set of curly braces.

Algorithm:

Declare a new variable that will represent the new array.
Use Object.values and .map to iterate through the values. 
Use a function to access each element's value, and add 1 to it.
console.log the new array to verify the results.

Question: How to access each element's value...

arr[index].key = value

Code:

let arr = [{ a: 1 }, { b: 2, c: 3 }, { d: 4, e: 5, f: 6 }];
let newArr = arr.map(element => (element[0] + 1))
