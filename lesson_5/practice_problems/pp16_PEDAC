Input: An array
Output: An object

Rules: 

New object must contain key value pairs where
the key is the first item in each subarray, and
the value is the second.

Data Structure:

Input: 

An array with four subarrays. Each subarray contains two elements, one is always a string, and the other can be a number, string, object, or array. I suppose it doesn't matter what the second item's value is.

Output:

An object with four key, value pairs.

Examples and Test Cases:

Input: 

let arr = [['a', 1], ['b', 'two'], ['sea', {'c': 3}], ['D', ['a', 'b', 'c']]];

Output:
{ a: 1, b: 'two', sea: { c: 3 }, D: [ 'a', 'b', 'c'] }

Algorithm:

Declare the variable with the input array.

Declare a variable with empty curly braces.

Iterate through the array, then through the nested arrays. Assign the first element as the new objects' keys, and the second element as the objects' values.

Code:

let arr = [{ a: 1 }, { b: 2, c: 3 }, { d: 4, e: 5, f: 6 }];
let newArr = arr.map(element => (element[0] + 1))
