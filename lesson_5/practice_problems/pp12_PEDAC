Input: An array
Output: An array

Rules: 

Must use the filter method
Must return a new array
New array must be identical in structure to the original
Must only return numbers from the original array that are multiples of 3

Data Structure:

Input: 

An array with four elements. Each element is an array.
The arrays only contain numbers.

Output:

The same structure as the input, but only containing multiples of 3.

Examples and Test Cases:

Input: 

let arr = [[2], [3, 5, 7], [9], [11, 15, 18]];

Output:

let arr = [[], [3], [9], [15, 18]];

Algorithm:

Use the map method on the original array to create a new array.
Use a function to access each element's value, and add 1 to it.
console.log the new array to verify the results.

Question: How to access each element's value...

arr[index].key = value

Code:

let arr = [{ a: 1 }, { b: 2, c: 3 }, { d: 4, e: 5, f: 6 }];
let newArr = arr.map(element => (element[0] + 1))
